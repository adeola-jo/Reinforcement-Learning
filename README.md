## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the exciting field of reinforcement learning. Each project folder contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and other resources to help you understand and implement various RL algorithms. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll find useful examples and detailed explanations here.

## Projects

### Project 1: Q-Learning

**Description**: Implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm on various environments from the OpenAI Gym library.

**Files**:
- `notebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation and step-by-step explanation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report explaining the Q-Learning algorithm, the experiments conducted, results obtained, and conclusions drawn from the project.

## Usage

Each project directory contains a Jupyter notebook. You can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook you are interested in, and follow the instructions within.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new project or an improvement to an existing project, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your contributions adhere to the existing style and structure of the repository.
